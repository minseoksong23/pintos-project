# Pintos
This repository hosts my solution for the Pintos project 1 (Threading) and 2 (User Programs). For now, details can be found in commit history (unfortunately, commit history for project 1 has disappeared). I will add documents and refine/further work on project 3 and 4 in the coming months.

## Acknowledgement
The initial source code was obtained from `git@github.com:PKU-OS/pintos.git`. This codebase has been modified for compatibility with MacOS, with the original adaptation work done by Professor Ryan Huang of Johns Hopkins University.
